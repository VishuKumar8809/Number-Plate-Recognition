 Number Plate Recognition Using OCR

This project implements an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) along with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for enhanced plate detection. The project integrates OpenCV for image processing, Pytesseract for extracting text, and utilizes a trained CNN model to improve the accuracy of number plate localization.



 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to recognize vehicle license plates using a hybrid approach that combines traditional image processing methods with machine learning. The system leverages Haar Cascades (.xml files) for detecting the license plate region and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) stored in a `.h5` file for more robust plate recognition in challenging environments.

This project focuses on:
1. Plate Detection: Using Haar Cascades for rapid number plate detection.
2. Enhanced Detection: Utilizing a pre-trained CNN for improved accuracy in complex conditions (blurry images, bad lighting).
3. Character Extraction: Using Pytesseract to extract characters from the number plate.
4. Post-processing: Refining recognized text to match standard license plate formats.

 Features
- Detects and recognizes vehicle license plates using both traditional and deep learning techniques.
- Integrates OpenCV, Haar Cascade classifiers, and a pre-trained CNN model.
- Extracts characters using Pytesseract for OCR.
- Designed for real-time applications with Raspberry Pi and Camera Module support.

 System Architecture

1. Input: Image or video stream.
2. Preprocessing: 
   - Grayscale conversion, blurring, and edge detection.
   - Haar Cascade-based detection using a `.xml` file.
   - Further plate refinement with CNN-based localization.
3. License Plate Detection: First, use the Haar Cascade `.xml` file to detect the plate, then fine-tune detection using a CNN stored in `.h5`.
4. OCR: Pytesseract extracts characters from the number plate region.
5. Output: The recognized number plate is printed as a string.

 Why Use `.xml` and `.h5` Files?

1. .xml File (Haar Cascade Classifier):
   - The `.xml` file contains a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier used for detecting objects like license plates. Haar Cascades are simple but effective methods for object detection and are particularly useful for rapid prototyping in license plate recognition.
   - This technique detects rectangular shapes, which can then be processed further.

2. .h5 File (Pre-trained CNN):
   - The `.h5` file stores a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained specifically for fine-tuning plate detection. The CNN can better handle complex cases, such as plates at different angles or in noisy environments.
   - This enhances the detection step, making it more robust than traditional methods like Haar Cascades alone.

 Installation

 Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You will also need:
- OpenCV
- Pytesseract
- Keras (for loading the CNN model)
- TensorFlow (backend for Keras)
- Numpy

 Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/number-plate-recognition.git
    cd number-plate-recognition
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python pytesseract keras tensorflow numpy
    ```

3. Download the Haar Cascade XML file:
   Download the Haar Cascade file for license plate detection from OpenCV's repository:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml
   ```

4. Load the pre-trained CNN model:
   You can either use a pre-trained CNN model stored as a `.h5` file or train your own. Place the `.h5` file in the project directory.

5. Install Tesseract OCR:
    - For Windows: Download and install [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract).
    - For Linux: Install via package manager:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
      ```

6. Configure Pytesseract: Ensure the path to the Tesseract executable is correctly set in your script:
    ```python
    pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'path_to_tesseract.exe'
    ```

 Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python number_plate_recognition.py
    ```

2. Input an image or video stream:
    - The system will prompt you to input an image file path or use a camera.

3. Output:
    - The system will output the recognized license plate number and display the processed image.

 Example
```bash
python number_plate_recognition.py --image examples/car.jpg
```

This will detect the plate, apply the CNN for fine-tuning, and extract the text.

 Future Enhancements
- Retrain the CNN on more diverse datasets to improve recognition in low-light and high-noise conditions.
- Integrate edge-based IoT solutions for faster real-time deployment.
- Explore YOLO-based object detection models for a more generalizable solution.
